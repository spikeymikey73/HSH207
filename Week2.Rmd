## Theoretical Frameworks

Better understanding of how SES can influence health (in either positive or negative ways) can be achieved through applying social determinants (including socioeconomic status) to addressing health inequities (via the use of theoretical models and frameworks).

### Ecological Perspective of Health

Can be better understood through the application of two of the key frameworks we draw on in HSH207:

-   Dahlgren and Whitehead's Ecological Model of Social Determinants of Health
-   Turrell's Socioeconomic Determinants of Health and Health Inequalities in Australia.
